## Features

### Authentication
- **2FA mode:** standard password login followed by a one-time SMS code
- **Passwordless login:** phone number + OTP only, no password needed
- **Both:** let each user choose their preferred method
- **Password reset via OTP:** replaces the default email reset flow with SMS
- **Per-role enforcement:** choose which user roles require OTP (e.g. skip OTP for subscribers)
- **Welcome SMS:** send a customisable welcome message when a new user registers
- **Google reCAPTCHA v3** and **Cloudflare Turnstile** bot protection
- **Country code dropdown** on login forms: restrict to GCC or custom country list

### Security
- Cryptographically secure OTP generation
- **Sliding-window rate limiting:** per-phone, per-IP, and per-account, immune to fixed-window boundary exploits
- **Duplicate OTP guard:** reuses existing valid OTP on double-click or page reload, no duplicate SMS
- **IP Allowlist/Blocklist:** CIDR support for IPv4 and IPv6. Allowlisted IPs bypass rate limiting; blocklisted IPs receive a silent refusal
- **IPHub proxy/VPN detection:** optional integration to silently block or flag OTP requests from known proxies and VPNs, with per-IP caching
- **Registration OTP gate:** verify phone number via OTP before the WordPress account is created, preventing registrations with invalid numbers
- **Trusted Devices:** after completing 2FA, users can trust a device for 30 days. Subsequent logins skip OTP on trusted devices. Tokens stored as SHA-256 hashes. Profile page shows all trusted devices with revoke controls
- **Phone blocking list:** block specific numbers from ever receiving an OTP (anti-enumeration)
- Timing-safe OTP verification
- Hardened session cookies
- Emergency bypass option for admin lockout recovery

### WooCommerce
- **7 order status SMS**: Processing, On-Hold (Shipped), Completed, Cancelled, Pending Payment, Refunded, Failed
- **Admin SMS notifications:** notify a configurable phone number on any order status change
- **Per-order custom SMS:** send a free-text SMS to the customer from the order edit screen
- **OTP gate on checkout:** verify phone before placing order, with optional COD-only mode
- **Stock alerts:** low stock, out-of-stock, and backorder notifications to admin
- **New product SMS:** notify admin when a product is first published
- **Back-in-stock notifications:** customers subscribe via product page, SMS sent when stock returns
- **Instant new order SMS:** fires once per order at checkout, before any status change
- **Multivendor support:** route order SMS to the vendor (Dokan, WCFM, WC Vendors)
- **Cart abandonment recovery:** detect abandoned carts, send recovery SMS with a generated coupon code, track recovery rate in the dashboard widget
- HPOS (High-Performance Order Storage) compatible

### Form Integrations: Notification or OTP Gate
Each integration supports two modes: **Notification** (send confirmation SMS on submit) or **OTP Gate** (block submission until phone is verified via OTP).

| Plugin | Auto-detected | Notification | OTP Gate |
|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Contact Form 7 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| WPForms | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Ninja Forms | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

## FAQ

**1. Do I need a kwtSMS account?**

Yes. Sign up free at [kwtsms.com](https://www.kwtsms.com/signup). API credentials (username and password, not your login mobile) are entered in kwtSMS > Gateway.

**2. What is the difference between Test Mode and Live Mode?**

In Test Mode, messages are queued on the kwtSMS server but never delivered to the recipient's phone. Credits are still deducted. To recover them, log in to your kwtSMS dashboard and delete the queued messages from the outbox. The OTP code is visible under **kwtSMS → Logs → Debug Log** so you can complete flows during development without a real phone. In Live Mode, the SMS is delivered and credits are deducted. Always develop with Test Mode on, then disable it before going live.

**3. My SMS status shows OK but the recipient did not receive it. What happened?**

Check the Sending Queue at [kwtsms.com](https://www.kwtsms.com/login/). If the message is stuck there, it was accepted but not dispatched. Common causes: emoji or hidden characters in the message body, spam filter triggers, or Test Mode still enabled. Delete the stuck message from the queue to recover your credits.

**4. What is a Sender ID and why should I not use the shared KWT-SMS sender?**

A Sender ID is the name that appears on the recipient's phone instead of a random number. `KWT-SMS` is a shared test sender: it causes delivery delays and is blocked on Virgin Kuwait. For OTP you must use a **Transactional** Sender ID, which bypasses DND filtering on Zain and Ooredoo. Promotional Sender IDs are silently filtered, meaning OTP messages fail while credits are still deducted. Register a private Sender ID through your kwtSMS account.

**5. I am getting an authentication error when I save my credentials. What should I check?**

The plugin requires your **API username and API password**, not your account mobile number or login password. Log in to [kwtsms.com](https://www.kwtsms.com/login/), go to Account > API settings, and copy the API credentials. They are case-sensitive.

**6. Can I send SMS to numbers outside Kuwait?**

International sending is disabled by default on all kwtSMS accounts. Log in to your kwtSMS account and activate coverage for the countries you need. Enable IP and phone rate limiting before turning on international coverage to prevent balance drain from automated abuse.

**7. Does the plugin work without WooCommerce?**

Yes. WooCommerce is fully optional. All login, password reset, and contact form features work on any WordPress site.

**8. How do I recover if I am locked out due to OTP?**

Add this line to `wp-config.php` (before the `/* That's all, stop editing! */` line):

```php
define( 'KWTSMS_OTP_DISABLED', true );
```

Log in normally, fix your phone number or gateway issue, then remove the line.

Alternatively, use WP-CLI to remove the phone from your account: `wp user meta delete <user_id> kwtsms_phone` (replace `<user_id>` with your user ID, usually `1` for the first admin).
