# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.3.3] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- Local phone numbers with a trunk prefix (single leading zero, e.g. Saudi `0559…`, UAE `050…`) are now correctly normalized: the trunk digit is stripped before the local-number length check, and the threshold is raised from 8 to 9 digits to cover 9-digit local formats. Matches the TypeScript `normalize()` implementation.

## [3.3.2] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- Country-specific phone number validation: `normalize_phone()` now checks local digit length and mobile starting digits for 70+ countries (GCC, Levant, MENA, Europe, Asia, Americas, Africa, Oceania). Rules are kept in sync with the TypeScript PHONE_RULES table. Numbers from countries not in the table continue to pass through with generic E.164 length validation only.

### Fixed
- Security: OTP codes are now stored as HMAC-SHA256 hashes in transients instead of plaintext. A database read can no longer reveal active OTP values.
- Security: Cart abandonment read-modify-write operations are now protected by a MySQL advisory lock, preventing concurrent race conditions.
- Security: Debug log and CSV export responses now include `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header.
- Security: Private IP detection in rate limiting now uses correct `172.16.0.0/12` CIDR instead of the overly broad `172.` prefix match, which incorrectly treated `172.0.0.0`-`172.15.255.255` as private.
- Security: API password is now saved with `wp_unslash()` only (not `sanitize_text_field()`), preserving special characters such as `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, and `'` that `sanitize_text_field()` stripped.
- Security: Checkout OTP send path now enforces per-phone and per-IP rate limits before issuing a code.
- Security: Cart recovery coupon codes now use `bin2hex(random_bytes(4))` for cryptographically secure entropy instead of a truncated MD5 hash.
- Added missing `is_ip_in_cidr()` method to `KwtSMS_OTP_Engine` that was referenced but never defined, causing a fatal error on every OTP attempt.

## [3.3.1] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- Elementor Pro and Gravity Forms form integrations are now fully active: removed "coming soon" status, both appear as live integrations on the Integrations overview page with install/activate/configure actions.

### Fixed
- Admin phone fields (order status, instant order, stock alerts, admin alerts) no longer send duplicate SMS when the same number is entered in both local and international format. Normalized phones are deduplicated before sending.
- `woo_admin_phone` (order status admin notification) now accepts space-separated phone numbers in addition to comma-separated, consistent with all other admin phone fields.
- WooCommerce sub-tab settings (stock alerts, multivendor, cart abandonment) were reset to defaults whenever the parent WooCommerce tab was saved, because unrendered checkboxes produce no POST data. Each sub-section now only updates its own fields when its specific tab is saved.
- Cart abandonment records with `recovered=true` were deleted when the cart was emptied after a successful purchase, losing recovery stats.
- Checkout OTP first-submit notice type changed from `notice` to `error` so WooCommerce correctly halts order creation while the customer retrieves their OTP code.
- Instant order and vendor SMS now also fire for WooCommerce block checkout orders via `woocommerce_store_api_checkout_order_processed`.
- Default SMS templates are now applied when saved template values are empty strings, ensuring out-of-box SMS content without requiring manual template entry.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- WooCommerce HPOS (High-Performance Order Storage) compatibility declaration.
- COD-only OTP gate option: require phone verification only for Cash on Delivery orders.
- Stock alert SMS notifications: low stock, out of stock, and backorder events sent to the configured admin phone.
- New product published SMS notification to admin.
- Back-in-stock subscriber notifications: customers opt in on the product page, SMS sent to all subscribers when stock is restored.
- Instant new order SMS alert, fires once per order regardless of payment method or initial status.
- Multivendor support: sends order SMS to the relevant vendor on Dokan, WCFM, or WC Vendors.
- Cart abandonment recovery SMS with optional percentage-off coupon code generation (single-use, configurable expiry).
- Cart abandonment dashboard card showing total tracked carts, SMS sent count, recovered orders, and recovery rate.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- Admin Site Alerts: configurable SMS notifications to admin phone on new user registration, login, post publish, comment, and WordPress core update events.
- Each alert has an individual enable/disable toggle and independent English and Arabic message templates.
- New "Admin Alerts" settings page under the kwtSMS admin menu.

## [3.0.4] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- GitHub Actions CI workflow: PHPCS, PHPStan, and PHPUnit run automatically on push and pull requests across PHP 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3.
- Automated plugin zip release: pushing a version tag (`vX.Y.Z`) now triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and publishes the release zip.
- Branch protection rules and PR template for the repository.

### Fixed
- PHPStan false positives in admin view files: suppressed `$this might not be defined`, defensive null-coalescing, offset-always-exists, and left-side-always-true errors that arise because view templates are included inside class methods.
- PHPUnit test assertions updated to reflect `wpcf7_submit` hook (changed from `wpcf7_mail_sent` in 3.0.3).
- PHPUnit test for Gravity Forms updated to match "Coming soon" display (no tab ID).
- Test placeholders: replaced real API username with `wp_username` throughout test files for client identification.

## [3.0.3] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- Password reset OTP SMS now sent correctly even when login OTP cooldown is active for the same user (cooldown is now scoped per action type).
- WooCommerce order total placeholder `{total}` no longer contains HTML entities in SMS messages.
- CF7 gate mode form auto-submit after OTP verification no longer throws TypeError when pendingForm is null.
- WPForms gate mode phone field detection now checks label text (WPForms uses non-standard input names).
- Settings `get()` method now correctly returns `$fallback` instead of undefined `$default` variable.
- Country code dropdown on SMS login page is now properly sized (constrained width, phone field takes remaining space).
- Admin notices and warnings from other plugins (e.g. Action Scheduler) now display above the kwtSMS logo header, not beside it.
- Admin sub-menu page hiding now uses CSS/JS and redirect instead of `remove_submenu_page`, preventing redirect loops.
- Users Without Phone page: menu count badge updates dynamically without page reload.

### Changed
- CF7 notification mode now sends SMS even when SMTP email delivery fails (hooks `wpcf7_submit` instead of `wpcf7_mail_sent`).
- Integrations page notes Elementor Pro requirement for form widgets.
- Integrations page notes Ninja Forms phone field configuration requirement.
- Gravity Forms shown on Integrations page as "Coming soon".

## [3.0.2] - 2026-03-07

- Enable Integration toggle moved into settings table, consistent across all form integrations.
- Restored left padding on WPForms admin pages stripped by WPForms.
